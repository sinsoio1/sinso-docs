Hello and welcome to SINSO! We are very happy to have you with us!ÔºÅ

Once start up and run your SINSO client, you will connect with peers around the world and become part of SINSO Getway. This is an international distributed cache network, responsible for storing and dispatching all data in the world.

SINSO Getway is a distributed-cache secondary network based on the outer layer of Filecoin. It is built for current use scenarios required by Gamefi, VR, AR, video streaming, as well as high-speed CDN and DAPP response. In addition to ensuring decentralization, user data privacy and security, SINSO Getway meanwhile focuses on improving efficiency.

Not as an underlying network protocol, SINSO Getway is a service-oriented middle-tier cache network with its positioning fundamentally different from Filecoin or AR, and instead as the L2 cache acceleration services provider for the Filecoin ecosystem.

SINSO Getway relieves all DAPPs from building IPFS adjacent nodes or other centralized nodes for data caching, and provides a safer L2 cache network with higher performance and lower cost. Since the acquisition of valid data and the construction of actual applications ecosystem have become the main orientation of Filecoin ecology construction, SINSO Getway will work on the standardization of communication protocols, so that mainstream data formats can be turned applicable to web3.0 ecology in an orderly manner.
