## As a guarantor, when staking for minerâ€™ nodes, how many nodes can I stake at one time?

The number of staked nodes cannot exceed 20 each time. Because you will also consume resources on-chain when you stake. Excessive one-time consumption will affect data writing.

## Why the online period of the node I staked is unstable (sometimes longer sometimes shorter)?

The longer the online period is, it means the better hardware and network you have, and the staked node will be more profitable and stable.

## My staked node is offline, what should I do?

When the offline period reaches 48 hours, it will trigger the punishement mechanism, since the offline period will also affect the Guarantor's income. If you encounter such a situation, don't worry too much. Because the system will help you switch to normally working nodes to ensure that your investment in staked tokens can continue to generate income.

1. View your staked nodes online Status

2. If a node that is offline for more than 48 hours is found, the "Switch Nodes" button will appear in the operation bar

3. Click the button "Switch Nodes", then the system will help you switch to a normal working node.

## When I stake a node, can I choose which node to stake?

Yes, you can, when you pledge, enter the account address of the management node that needs to pledge the node address in the input box, and you can search for the node address you want to pledge, and then you can pledge to the node you want to pledge.
