## Why my node can't start, and there’s a prompt to open the external network ports?

The SINSO storage network requires each node to open the p2p port to maintain the smoothness of the network so that the data can remain active in the network, so you must open the corresponding p2p port to start the program.

## My network is accessed through a router, how to open the external network port?

Node port 1634,you need to open the external network port 1634 on the router

Each router hardware device is different, please refer to your device’s introduction.

## Why is my node going offline?

SINSO’s working nodes will utilize the hardware CPU, memory, hard disk and network performance. If your computer configuration is not qualified, the node will go offline.

## Can I stake for my own node as a guarantor?

Yes, you can, as long as your guarantor address is not the same as your working node address.

## Can I find a friend to stake for my node as a guarantor?

Yes, you can, you need to provide your node management account to your friends, let them search for your node through the node management account and then complete the staking process.

## How are the benefits of my nodes and the role of Guarantor distributed, all to my address?

No, the node income is distributed in real-time through the contracts on-chain. The proceeds corresponding to Node Miners and Guarantors will be issued to their addresses.

## Why does my node still show offline when it is started?

Because the data on-chain will be synchronized when the node starts for the first time, you need to wait patiently, and you can check the node log for observation.

## How long does it take for my node to reconnect to the Mainnet after it goes offline and restarts?

After your node goes offline and restarts, the node will be reactivated, and then the data on-chain will be synchronized. Please wait patiently. You can check the node log for observation.
