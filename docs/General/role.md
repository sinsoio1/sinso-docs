## Validate Nodes

The verification node in the Sinso network is responsible for processing the work certificates of the nodes in the whole network, receiving the online work information of the nodes and verifying it, so as to ensure that each node can receive corresponding rewards after hard work. The verification node itself will also be ranked according to the verification workload. The higher the score, the higher the reward the verification node will get.

Verification node score/total verification node score = score percentage
Verification node's own score percentage \* total number of verification awards = number of own awards

## Upload Node

The upload node in the Sinso network is responsible for the upload and distribution of the entire network data. It is the transmitter of the data source. The upload node will submit the file type, name and size to the verification node for verification. The larger the total capacity of the uploaded file, the higher the points obtained through verification, the higher the reward。

Total upload capacity score of upload node/total upload capacity score of online upload node = node upload capacity score percentage

Percentage of node upload capacity score \* number of upload awards=number of upload node awards

## Storage Node

The storage node in the Sinso network is responsible for the storage and access of the entire network data. It is the most important part of the whole network. Receive and store the file blocks distributed throughout the network, and report them to the verifier for verification and record. The more file blocks stored, the higher the score, the higher the reward。

Score of total storage capacity of storage nodes/score of total storage capacity of storage nodes of the whole network=percentage of upload capacity of storage nodes

Percentage of storage node upload capacity \* number of storage awards = number of storage node awards

## Guarantee

"Guarantee" is an important mechanism in SINSO consensus GPOS, which makes the token of node pledge come from the guarantee of the guarantor.

Any account with a sinso token can become a guarantor, and its sinso can be used as a guarantee asset to provide security for nodes and obtain guarantee income。
